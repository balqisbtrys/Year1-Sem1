### 🌟Reflection
Through this course, I developed a stronger foundation in logical and structured thinking. Learning topics such as logic, sets, relations, and graphs helped me understand how to analyze problems systematically and apply mathematical reasoning. These skills are essential not only for solving theoretical problems but also for designing efficient solutions in computer science. I feel more confident approaching complex problems with a clear and step-by-step method.
