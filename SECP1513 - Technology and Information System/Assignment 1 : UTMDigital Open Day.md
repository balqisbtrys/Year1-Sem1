## Reflection
For me, UTMDigital Open Day have given great benefits to students. It expanded my insight and gave a clearer view of the future path. By visiting the data centre and attending the talks, I learned about how technology is managed and applied in real situations, including agile methodology, scrum method and many more.

I also had the chance to interview one of the UTMDigital staff, which gave me an experience in conducting interviews. The activities really sparked excitement about the future.

Before this visit, my knowledge was mostly theoretical. But now, I have seen how technology is implemented in the real world. For example, UTMDigital has developed many systems such as MyUTM Portal, e-Learning platform, UTM Wi-Fi and other management systems that used by students and staff.
