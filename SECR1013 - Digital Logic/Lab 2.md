## Lab 2 : Combinational Digital Circuit Design Simulation Using Deeds Simulator

- Lab 2 must be done using Deeds software and not carried out in the Digital Laboratory. 

Objectives :
<br> i) To expose student with producing digital logic circuit, generating truth table and Timing Diagram with Deeds Simulator
<br> ii) To expose student with a complete cycle process of a combinatorial circuit design and simulate with Deeds Simulator
